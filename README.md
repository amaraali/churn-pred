# MLProject-Churn-Prediction

### Introduction
This repository holding a case study on analysis churn in Telecom and building a machine learning model to classify the customer who is likely to churn, which includes EDA, Prediction Model Building, Presentation PDF.
<br><br>

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from IBM Sample Data Sets, which hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). For more information, please refers to the Kaggle dataset description.
